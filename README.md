# Hotel-Bookings-EDA
Project Summary
The aim of this project was to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset in order to gain insights into customer behavior and booking patterns. The dataset contained information on hotel bookings, including booking dates, customer demographics, and reservation details. First, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, which involved removing missing values, handling duplicates. Then we visualized the data using various graphical techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps. Through our analysis, we discovered several interesting insights. For example, we found that most bookings were made between july and August.


Problem Statement
Have you ever considered the ideal season of the year to reserve a hotel room? Alternatively, how long should I remain to get the greatest daily rate? What if you wanted to foretell whether a hotel would unreasonably frequently receive unusual requests? You can investigate those questions using the data from hotel reservations! This data collection comprises reservation details for a city hotel and a resort hotel, as well as details like the date the reservation was made, the duration of the stay, the number of adults, kids, and/or babies, and the number of parking spaces that are available. The data is free of any information that may be used to identify an individual. Explore and assess the information to find important details
